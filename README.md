# ZipItems Algorithm

## Purpose
- zipItems function shuffles generated sequence two into sequence one
- an output returns a new combination of sequences ending with an item of first sequence regardless of parity or condition

## Technology pick
- I've picked alternative Node runtime, Deno.js to have type safety,  
testing module and benchmarking without the need introducing additional packages or libraries
- Algorithm implementation is purely written in TypeScript

## How to run
### Local
install from [here](https://deno.land/#installation)
- run tests 
```bash
deno run test
```

### Docker
- TBD
